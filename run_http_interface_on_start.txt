# to automatically start the webserver on start, run crontab -e
# then add the following line at the end of the file
# don't forget to replace <username> by the username you have on the pi
@reboot cd /home/ohmpi/ohmpi;bash run_http_interface.sh > startup.log

# if you want to run the pi as a hotspot, you can follow the instruction
# at https://www.raspberrypi.com/tutorials/host-a-hotel-wifi-hotspot/
# NOTE that activating the hotspot will disconnect the Pi from the Wi-Fi

sudo nmcli device wifi hotspot ssid <hotspot name> password <hotspot password> ifname wlan0

sudo nmcli connection modify <hotspot name> connection.autoconnect yes

# if multiple wifi are configured on the RPi, you may want to either add
# the line below to /etc/rc.local or modify the connection.priority to 100
# such that the access point is proritized over other visible network
sudo nmcli connection up hotspot

# to connect to the Pi in AP mode, connect to the Wi-Fi <hostpot name>
# you can then access the dashboard on http://<raspberrypi_name>.local:8000
