# OhmPi

Development of a low-cost multi-electrodes resistivity meter for electrical resistivity mesaurement for lab applications, based on raspberry board

## Installation

1. Download a .zip of this repository (or use `git clone https://gitlab.com/ohmpi/ohmpi.git`)
2. Enter the repository (`cd path/to/ohmpi`) and install the software needed. We made a simple script to make it simpler:

`./install.sh`

The installation script will create a virtual python environement `ohmpy` (with a 'y' at the end) where all packages specified in *requirements.txt* will be installed. The script also takes care of creating a configuration for your hardware if you wish.

To activate the environment and set the necessary `$PYTHONPATH` variable, you can use:

`source env.sh`

More examples are provided in the **[documentation](https://ohmpi.gitlab.com/ohmpi)**.
