OHMPI: Open source and open hardware resistivity-meter
======================================================



.. sidebar:: Summary

    :Release: |release|
    :Date: |today|
    :Date start: July 2016	
    :Authors: **Rémi CLEMENT, Nicolas FORQUET, Yannick FARGIER, Vivien DUBOIS, Hélène GUYARD, Olivier KAUFMANN, Guillaume BLANCHY, Arnaud WATLET**
    :Target: users, researchers and developers 
    :tatus: some mature, some in progress

This documentation presents the development of a low-cost, open hardware
resistivity meter to provide the scientific community with a robust
and flexible tool for small-scale experiments. Called OhmPi, this basic resistivity meter
features current injection and measurement functions associated with a multiplexer
that allows performing automatic measurements.
OhmPi's philosophy is to provide a fully open source and open hardware tool
to the near surface scientific community.

The following sections presents the hardware and software characteristics of OhmPi, and details how to build
a system from scratch and operate it.
