This documentation presents the development of a low-cost, open hardware
resistivity meter to provide the scientific community with a robust
and flexible tool for small-scale experiments. Called OhmPi, this basic resistivity meter
features current injection and measurement functions associated with a multiplexer
that allows performing automatic measurements.
