Introduction
************

The OhmPi project was initiated to develop an open-source, open-hardware resistivity meter,
particularly designed for the research community, education, and humanitarian or not-for-profit organisations.
In the last decade, geoelectrical monitoring has become a popular tool to study and monitor
physical processes in hydrology. As novel applications emerge, the need for more accessible and flexible acquisition systems
grows in the research community. The flexibility and adaptability of OhmPi makes it particularly suited to
develop novel acquisition strategies or design innovative small-scale monitoring experiments.

.. note::
   Anyone who wants to get involved is welcome to join the OhmPi project!
