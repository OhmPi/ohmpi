Measurement board 2024.0.2
===========================

The 2024.0.2 measurement board has been developed to replace the 2023.0.1 measurement board. It offers superior performance compared to its predecessor. 
The current measurement component has not evolved and presents no major differences. However, the major upgrade is the Mikroe-1887 module. Specifically, 
it provides electrical isolation for the Vmn measurement set. This isolation allows for injection voltages (Vab) up to 200V
